## Component Mapping

| Component type | Token |
|---|---|
| Subtle separators, tiny UI details | shadow-2xs or shadow-xs |
| Inputs, form controls, pressed elements | shadow-inset |
| Buttons, small controls, lightweight cards | shadow-sm or shadow-md |
| Standard cards, popovers, dropdowns | shadow-md |
| Prominent cards, sticky surfaces | shadow-lg |
| Modals, high-priority overlays | shadow-xl |
| Hero overlays, top-level emphasis (sparingly) | shadow-2xl |

## Rules

- Use only these tokens — no custom box-shadow values
- Neumorphic depth comes from dual-directional shadows: a dark shadow on the bottom-right and a light shadow on the top-left
- Use shadow-inset for elements that should appear pressed into the surface (inputs, active states)
- Use raised shadow tokens (shadow-sm through shadow-2xl) for elements that should appear elevated from the surface
- Keep elevation steps intentional; avoid jumping multiple levels
- Components in the same family share the same baseline elevation
- Hover/focus on interactive elevated elements: step up by one level
- Never stack multiple shadow tokens on one element
- Never use shadow-xl/shadow-2xl for dense list items or body containers
- In dark mode, shadow colors must be adjusted to match the dark surface (#262833): use darker/lighter variants of the surface color instead of #b8b9be/#ffffff
